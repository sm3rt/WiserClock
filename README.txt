# WiserClock
This is an alternative firmware for the awesome [WiseClock3][] by Florin C.
 
Updated by Quentin Smart from version by the-kenny (Moritz Ulrich) https://github.com/the-kenny/WiserClock
This version runs on normal Arduino hardware with a DS1307 clock and temperature model from eBay.

Change Log
- Added new clock faces for Life (fixed algorithm from WiseClock3) 
- Added Pong (from WiseClock4)
- Added modified Simple face (from WiseClock3)
- Configuration via capacitive sensing buttons.
- DS1307 clock and Temperature

I'm developing this firmware to provide a cleaner, easier-extendable codebase which enables people to write awesome stuff for the WiseClock3 without much fuss. I started this because I found the codebase of the original firmware way too messy and confusing (no offense!).
