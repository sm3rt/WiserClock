# WiserClock
This is an alternative firmware for the awesome [WiseClock3][] by Florin C.

I'm developing this firmware to provide a cleaner, easier-extendable codebase which enables people to write awesome stuff for it without much fuss. I started this because I found the codebase of the original firmware way too messy and confusing (no offense!).
